I would like to make a game with shooting, score keeping, and levelling elements. The game would be about a protagonist who must protect his cows from being abducted by UFOs. The objective of the game is to reach the highest level possible. In this game I would like to attempt to use arrays. I would also like to make a level up function that randomly generates a new scene with certain variables that are determined. I will also add sound elements to each character (protagonist, cows, UFOs).
