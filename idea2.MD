I would like to make a game that uses a similar structure to Subway Surfer or Tomb Runner. I would like to generate a random matrix of obstacles that the user must navigate through. The objective of the game is to reach a highest score. Additionally, I would like to make the game save the highest score and display it every time the user loses. I will attempt to use arrays to generate the random obstacles. I will also add sound effects for the userâ€™s movements as well as certain obstacles.
